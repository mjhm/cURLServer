            <h3>About cURL Server</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This cURL Server is an AWS Linux instance that can process cURL commands.
              <ul>
                <li>The processing protocol is JSONRPC.</li>
                <li>It has both synchronous and queued asynchronous modes.</li>
                <li>The core glue technology is all open source, mostly python, and pretty well documented.  
                See the "Software Manifest" tab for details.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>The primary application for a cURL Server is to patch protocol mismatches for transferring files among cloud services.</li>
              <li>The initial and primary use case (for me) is tranferring S3 files to Google App Engine's Blobstore. Other use cases could include:
              <ol>
                <li>Transferring files from an FTP site to S3.</li>
                <li>Transferring files from an FTP site to GAE Blobstore.</li>
                <li>Concatenating GAE blobstore files.</li>
                <li>Fixing mimetypes, filenames, or other manipulations on route to another cloud service.</li>
                <li>Provide an intermediary between a fast expensive file source, and a slow inexpensive destination. (or vice-versa)</li>
                <li>Limited (non JavaScript) browser emulation.</li>
              </ol>
            </ul>
            <h3>Quick Start</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>If you're unfamiliar with cURL click on the "About cURL" tab, and get a handle on the main cURL documentation.</li>
              <li>Next view "cURL Web Client" tab.</li>
              <li>Play with the <a href="curl_web_client.html">client</a>.  Check out the "Presets" to get oriented, 
              and refer back to the cURL documentation to try out you're own ideas.</li>
              <li>If you are going to use this with GAE, go to the "GAE Details" tab.  Copy and install the unit test application.</li>
              <li>If you intend to put this into a production situation, definitely copy it to your own AMI image.  
              It is very likely that this image will be replaced by a newer AMI in the future.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>What cURL Server is Not</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>The cURL Server and the Web Client are not a general user interface for cURL.  The primary role of the Web Client is to test cURL
              commands and to help programmers construct JSON-RPC requests for the server.</li>
              <li>The cURL Server is not a public web service.  This is your instance and you can do whatever you want with it, 
              but it wasn't designed as public user facing application.</li>
              <li>The cURL Server is not an FTP server.  cURL functions as an FTP client, not a server.  You can certainly install 
              an FTP server on this instance, but that is beyond the scope of this application.</li>
              <li>The cURL server is not persistent storage.  In fact all files in <code>/tmp/jsonrpc</code> are automatically 
              deleted after 24 hours.</li>
              <li>The installed command line version of curl doesn't have SMTP or POP3 support.  So it can't directly send email.
              However it would probably be better to implement a separate <code>email</code> method that goes through python's
              <code>smtplib</code> module.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Other Cool Stuff</h3>
            In addition to providing a tool that connects GAE and AWS, 
            this application also has live working examples of a JSON-RPC server, a python daemon for running the asynchronous queue, matched
            HMAC/SHA1 signatures between JavaScript and Python, and uses some of the slick tools from the YUI3 JavaScript library.  None of
            this is earth shattering, but accessible working examples may be useful to some.
            See the "Software Manifest" tab for more details.

          <div id="about-curl">
            <h3 class="pagetitle"> cURL groks URLs </h3> 
            From the main cURL web site (<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">http://curl.haxx.se/</a>):
            <p class="ingres"> 
              curl is a command line tool for transferring data with URL syntax,
              supporting DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP,
              LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and
              TFTP. curl supports SSL certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading,
              HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password authentication
              (Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate, kerberos...), file transfer resume, proxy
              tunneling and a busload of other <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/features.html">useful
              tricks</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>cURL Usage and Documentation</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Of course all of the cURL website documentation was written for the command line version,  
              but almost all of it applies equally to the cURL Server.</li>
              <li>Additionally keep in mind that command line <code>curl</code> is installed on this instance.  Just log on to the instance through 
              PuTTY or other terminal client, and run <code>curl &lt;args&gt;</code></li>
              <li>Lots of examples are explained in <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manual.html">http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manual.html</a></li>
              <li>The main reference documentation is in <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html">http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html</a></li>
              <li>If you will be using this to upload to GAE, you'll want to read the documentation for the '-F' option carefully.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div id="curl-web-client">
            <h2>cURL Web Client</h2>
            <div>
              <a href="curl_web_client.html">curl_web_client.html</a> is a web based interface to this cURL Server.  
              It's main purpose is to test cURL commands and to help you construct JSON-RPC requests for the cURL Server.
            </div>
            <h3>Usage</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>The first thing you will need is the Private DNS for this instance.  
              This is used as the hashkey for signing cURL server requests.  You can get this from the AWS control panel 
              or by running <code>curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-hostname</code> on the instance command line.
              See the "Security and Privacy" tab for more information about the signature strategy.</li>
              <li>You probably want to put in a specific name for <code>tmpdir</code>.  The default behavior is to use the pid of the request's 
              process as the <code>tmpdir</code>, but this is obviously different for every request.</li>
              <li>Note also that all files and directories under <code>/tmp/jsonrpc</code> are automatically deleted after 24 hours.</li>
              <li>Start out selecting cURL options with the "Presets".  Click the "curl" button to run. (BTW. if you have examples
              of other interesting cURL applications that would be appropiate for the "Presets" please send them to me so that I can include
              them in a future release.)</li> 
              <li>Look below the tab frame for your results.  This includes the URI to the server, the JSON-RPC request, 
              and the result sent back from the server.</li>
              <li>It's worth noting that the client and the server have the same domain.  Don't be confused by this.  You can send this same
              request from any web location.  The Web Client just needs to run on the server to avoid JavaScript cross domain AJAX requests.</li>
              <li>On the "Utilities" tab there are five additional functions that the cURL Server understands, all of which are 
              mostly self explanatory.</li>
              <li>"cat" concatenates files in <code>tmpdir</code>, however the method can also be used to view the contents of 
              a file by leaving the last argument blank.</li>
              <li>Note also that the actual JSON-RPC <code>cat</code> method can take any number of input files.</li>
              <li> "Upload" is not an actual JSON-RPC method, but it can be teamed with JSON-RPC requests.  In the Web Client, it is teamed with
              a "listdir" request.  See the cURL Server Reference tab for details.</li>
              <li>Switch to Asychronous mode to test the queue.  cURL response objects in asynchronous mode tell you where to look 
              for the results on the server. You can use "listdir" and "cat" requests to examine those results.</li>
              <li>The "Run Diagnositics" button will print out a ton of information about the last request.  It should be enough to
              diagnose most problems, but if it isn't you probably have to crack open a server shell.  Nevertheless the diagnostics should give you 
              at least a starting place.</li>
            </ol>

              <h3>URI Options</h3>
              <div>
                The basic URI has the form:
                <pre>
                  http://&lt;Public DNS&gt;/cgi-bin/jsonrpc.py?signature=&lt;signature&gt;&amp;&lt;option1&gt;&amp;&lt;option2&gt;...
                </pre>
                <table class="option-table">
                  <tr>
                  <td class="table-left">signature<i>(required)</i></td>
                  <td class="table-right">The <code>signature</code> is computed from the formula (Python):
                  <pre>
          import sha, base64, hmac
          h=hmac.new(hashkey,request_str,sha)
          signature = base64.b64encode(h.digest()) 
                  </pre>
                  Where <code>request_str</code> is the full JSON-RPC request string, and 
                  <code>hashkey</code> is a string that matches between the client and server.  
                  The <code>hashkey</code> is currently programmed to be the Private DNS of the AWS Server instance.
                  However this can be easily changed in <code>/var/www/cgi-bin/jsonrpc.py</code>.

                  <tr>
                  <td class="table-left">async <i>(default: 0)</i></td>
                  <td class="table-right">This directs the request to use asynchronous mode.  The request returns right away with a pointer 
                  to <code>tmpdir</code> for the request.  No direct completion notices are given, but the user can use cURL commands to 
                  post custom completion notices.  See the "sequence" call below.</td>

                  Logging, file uploads, posts, downloads, and concatenations, etc. happen relative to this directory.  
                  Files and directories below the <code>/tmp/jsonrpc</code> directory are automatically deleted in 24 hours.</td>

            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>File Uploads</h3>
              <p>The cURL Server can handle <code>multipart/form-data</code> posts, and files can be directly posted to the cURL Server
              along with a JSON-RPC request.  
              For such requests the cURL Server expects one of the parts to be named "jsorpc" and contain the actual JSON-RPC request.
              This request could be a "ping" or as in the case of the Web Client a "listdir", or it could be a more complex request.
              If the request is made in asyncronous mode the files are uploaded before the request is queued. </p> 
              
              <p>The request form from the Web Client looks something like:</p>
              <pre>
&lt;form method="POST" id="upload-form" 
    action="http://ec2-...us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/cgi-bin/jsonrpc.py?signature=...;tmpdir=tmpdir3&amp;async=1&amp;log=1" 
    enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
  &lt;input type="hidden" value="{&amp;quot;jsonrpc&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;2.0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:3,&amp;quot;method&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;listdir&amp;quot;}" name="jsonrpc" id="jsonrpc-upload"&gt;
  &lt;input type="button" value="upload" id="upload-submit"&gt;
  &lt;input type="file" value="" name="upload_this" size="40" id="cat_out"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
              </pre>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>JSON-RPC Request Methods</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  The JSON-RPC request/response format follows the near final proposal: 
                  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/json-rpc/web/json-rpc-2-0">JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification</a>.
                  However for the purposes of this application I recommend caution in using the "batch" form -- for most applications you probably
                  want to use the "sequence" method instead (see below).  Requests run from a batch array are not guaranteed to run in order,
                  they don't necessarily share the same tmpdir, and the batch array doesn't have an "id" of its own.  The "sequence" method
                  addresses these issues.
                </p>
                <p>Adding additional methods is straight forward. Just follow the pattern of the existing methods in 
                <code>/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/jsonrpc_procs.py</code></p>
                <table class="command-table">
                  <tr>
                    <td class="table-left">curl</td>
                    <td class="table-right">Runs the command line curl program through a python subprocess, with the parameter array passed directly
                    as arguments.  Returns the stdout of the command as a string.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td class="table-left">cat</td>
                    <td class="table-right">This concatenates the file arguments up to the <code>&gt;</code> argument. 
                    The file specified after the <code>&gt;</code> argument is
                    the output file.  If <code>&gt;</code> or the output file is missing the result of the 
                    concatenation is passed to the response return string. 
                    Note that the <code>&gt;</code> argument is only symbolic, it has no deeper meaning.  
                    So, for example, don't try replacing it with <code>|</code> to

                    requests.<br/><br/>
                    Most of the time users will want to use the <code>sequence</code> method with asynchronous requests.  
                    For example a sequence could have one
                    or more <code>curl</code> method calls to retrieve files, a <code>cat</code> call to concatentate those files, 
                    a <code>curl</code> call to upload the
                    concatenated files, and finally another <code>curl</code> call to send a notification of completion.
                    This will often take too long for a synchronous operation. 
                    The example below shows such a compound request.</td>

            <h3>Google App Engine</h3>
            <p>
              <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> is an extremely functional, powerful, and easy to use 
              Platform-as-a-Service.  In addition to the GAE Datastore database system, Google also provides a Blobstore system for storing
              larger unstructured data.  However the Blobstore has a couple of limitations.  Files can only be transferred to the Blobstore
              via HTTP file post requests, and once uploaded the blobs are not editable.  The cURL Server can be used to work around these
              limitations.  In particular it can be used to download blobs to files, manipulate those files, and POST the files back to the
              blobstore.  Potential use cases that have come up in the Google App Engine forums include:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Copying files from S3 to the Blobstore (my primary use case).</li>
              <li>Copying files from an FTP site to the Blobstore.</li>
              <li>Changing the mimetype or filename of a file on route to the Blobstore.</li>
              <li>Combining Blobstore files.</li>
              <li>Copying files from the GAE datastore to the Blobstore.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The easiest way to understand how to use GAE with the cURL Server is to grab the GAE 
              <a href="http://github.com/mjhm/cURLServer/blob/master/curl_test.py"><code>curl_test.py</code></a> application file.  
              Install it within
              a GAE application, and run the test suites.  Instructions will be on its default page 
              <code>http://&lt;your_app&gt;.appspot.com/curl_test</code>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="security-privacy">
          
            <h3>Privacy</h3>
            <p>This instance only uses Google Analytics to collect information about the use of the HTML pages on this instance.
            You can easily remove the Google Analytics sections from the HTML pages without otherwise affecting the operation of the instance.
            No other information is collected.  In particular I am not monitoring usage of the JSON-RPC server itself, and I have no reason
            to believe that any of the 3rd party code used, including the "curl" program itself, does any external data collection. 
 
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p> Although I can give no warranty about the security of this instance, I have given it some thought.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>My security priority for this instance has been to prevent unauthorized users from stealing CPU cycles.  The primary
              deterrent is that a user must know both the Public DNS (to access the site) and the Private DNS (to use the JSON-RPC server).</li>
              <li>The Public DNS shouldn't be considered especially secure.</li>
              <li> On the other hand, obtaining the Private DNS requires access to either 
              the AWS Control Panel or other AWS account level access, or access to the instance itself.  However AWS uses a limited range
              of values for the numbers in their Private DNS names.  
              Therefore a determined hacker could probably crack the instance relatively easily.</li>
              <li>An easy fix for this is to create a more secure hashkey and put it in the instance startup "user-data".  Code for using the
              "user-data" instead of the Private DNS is in a few commented lines of <code>/var/www/cgi-bin/jsonrpc.py</code>.  I recommend this
              change for any serious production usage.
              <li>I don't recommend using the AWS Tags for storing the hashkey because they require the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_ACCESS_ID
              to access them.  I prefer avoiding the risk of exposure of this information, because I don't want a breach of security on the instance 
              to become a breach of security to the whole AWS account.</li>
              <li>The cURL Server was not designed for secure multi tenant use.  Though it could probably be modified to be so.</li>
              <li>It's possible that the cURL command line program may have security vulnerabilities that would be exposed by this application.</li>
              <li>Another easy change would be to implement a "delete" JSON-RPC method in 
              <code>/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packates/jsonrpc_procs.py</code>.  This would allow users to delete sensitive files immediately
              after they are used (instead of automatically in 24 hours).  However this is a low priority item for my usage.</li>
            </ul>
